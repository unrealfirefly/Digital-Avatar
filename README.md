## üåü Why Digital Avatar?

Digital Avatar uses **PAE (Pattern Analysis & Emulation)** to autonomously interact with desktop applications. This means it works **fully offline, with no external APIs required.**

The current MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focuses on **Excel automation**.

**For Businesses:** This technology allows you to automate Excel reports and workflows offline without APIs. Contact me at diktofonchik@gmail.com to discuss custom solutions.

**Example:** The script autonomously opens Excel via Spotlight, reads the data from cell **B5** of the `test.xlsx` file, and outputs the result to the Terminal. This validates PAE‚Äôs ability to read, analyze, and act on local data without user intervention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Zero-Budget Project)

I'm not a programmer, just a guy with a vision for autonomous AI, building this with zero budget. Join me to make it real!

  - **Python**: Core language.
  - **PAE**: The **Proprietary PAE core** is being developed locally. The open source components use **PyAutoGUI** (for GUI emulation) and are preparing to integrate **OpenCV** (for visual element detection).
  - **Excel Handling**: **openpyxl** for fast reading of Excel files.
  - **Platform**: macOS (MacBook Air M1).
  - **Requirements**: Mac with 8GB RAM, 5GB disk space. Note: M1 performance may be slow with large Excel files (\~2‚Äì5s latency). Consider using DeepSeek-Coder:1b for better performance.

## üöÄ Start in 5 Minutes (No Coding Required)

1.  Download the ZIP file of the project from GitHub.
2.  Create a `test.xlsx` file (e.g., cell B5 contains "Sample Data").
3.  Unzip the project and open your Terminal in the root folder.
4.  Run the Excel analyzer script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/excel_analyzer.py --file test.xlsx
    ```
5.  Check the Terminal output for the cell B5 results.

## ü§ù Help Us

Your contribution will help us build cloud-independent AI that can rival Siri and Alexa.

**Contributors can help by focusing on these areas:**

  * Testing Excel scripts on various Mac/Windows setups.
  * Optimizing `openpyxl` operations on the M1 chip for faster parsing.
  * Adding support for other office suites (e.g., Google Sheets or LibreOffice).
  * Reporting issues and suggesting additional MVP features via GitHub Issues.

**Why Join?** You'll learn OpenCV and Pandas for automation, build API-free AI with a zero-budget team, and help shape the future of autonomous applications.
